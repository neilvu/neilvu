It all begins with #programmingwithaPURPOSE.

As a data science/analytics aspirant, I am mostly interested in learning how to abstract data using a variety of different programming languages like SQL, Python, R, and API/JSON in order to analyze data content for investigative analysis. I am currently in progress on programming different settings that are applicable to real-life scenarios like data abstracting, engineering, cloud data and statistical analysis in order to understand how programming can lead to different ways of life as well with issues to provide a more justifiable solution such as combating fraud/waste all the way to data maintenance to make better decisions for everyone.

By working on projects, it will help me get a sense of what the data/programming environment is and the bigger picture as well. I look forward to work on professional certification(s) as well going above to make a difference with the community throughout this career, whether to the private as well as the public, to safeguard the innocent, and to bring justice for our state and our nation.
